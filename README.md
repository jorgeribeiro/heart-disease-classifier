## Acknowledgment
This project could not be built without the help of this [article from medium](https://medium.com/@dvelsner/deploying-a-simple-machine-learning-model-in-a-modern-web-application-flask-angular-docker-a657db075280).

It was my first time using Flask and its author made it simple to understand and integrate Flask with sklearn.
He also provides a simple interface built with Angular.
